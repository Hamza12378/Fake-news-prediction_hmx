# Fake-news-prediction_hmx
Welcome to the "Fake News Prediction" project repository! This project focuses on using machine learning to predict whether a news article is fake or real based on a provided dataset in CSV format.


# Contents

# 1. Dataset: 
I provide a CSV dataset that contains news articles along with labels indicating whether each article is fake or real. The dataset is a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models.

# 2. Jupyter Notebook:
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook file named "Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb." In this notebook, we perform the following tasks:

**-Data Exploration:** 
We delve into the dataset to understand its structure, and distribution of features, and perform initial data analysis.

**-Data Preprocessing**: 
We preprocess the data, including handling missing values, text data cleaning, and feature engineering.

**-Machine Learning Models:** 
We implement machine learning models to predict fake news, including data splitting, model training, and evaluation.

**-Results and Insights:** 
We present the results and insights from our analysis and model performance.

# 3. Requirements:
To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce our analysis, please refer to the requirements listed in the README file. We recommend setting up a Python environment with the necessary libraries to get started.
